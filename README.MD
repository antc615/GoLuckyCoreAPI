Pending Work for GoLucky:

UserHome

1. The UX mechanisms needs improvements
   a. If there is a match there needs to be something in the UI that tells the user
   b. After liking or disliking someone the Profile should be grayed out and the page should jump to the next user. The buttons should also be hidden
   c. If a user has too many photos the paginator freaks out
   d. Rethink the aboutme stuff/ biography. Whats important here?
   e. Implement the filters / notifications in the top banner
   f. Ensure once a user is liked they do not reappear on feed
   g. Save state and refresh daily. New matches every day UX old matches loaded until refresh

Notificaitons

1. We need notifs built our
   a. matching
   b. messaging
   c. sales

Reccommendations

1. Implement

Payments / Revenue

1. Need work on figuring out what were selling and how to implement it
   a. What features will be supported?
   b. How can we charge for booked dates?
   c. How do we implement the features into the software and add paywalls

Messages

1. Need work on core functionalities
   a. We need to add a feature to "start chat" probably when the user clicks their profile. This would prevent async messages from being started. When you want to chat with someone you "prompt them" to start chatting. If they hit yes you are transfered to a chat room with them. If not they stay in your matches
   I. More thoughts on this. If user b hits "no" there should be a system that prompts them later to "would you like to start chat with user A?" That was its not just one user being creepy and annoying to the other. If user B hits "no" again, should be prompted to unmatch
   b. Book Date functionality. There needs to be a way to say im "going on a date with this person" with some UX feedback
   c. Implement the "their turn / your turn / hidden" REST calls
   d. Replace "start game / chat" with unmatch / report
   d. Hidden needs a CRON / script to clean up chats after a certain period of time
   e. Data modeling for chats probably needs hidden / your turn their turn implemented

Profile

1. Some serious work needed on core functionality
   a. The image selector is bad and needs updating
   b. Allow more images
   c. Allow prompts for emotional connections
   d. Improve UI
   e. More data modeling

User Profile (their dating page)
a. Slight refactor
b. Allow the user profile info into the user profile like bumble or a standard dating profile

The waitlist system and ui/componentss

1. When new user logs in they should be prompted that they are on a waitlist. The waitlist should show
   a. How many other users are on the waitlist
   b. How long the expected wait is
   c. check other waitlists
   d. there should be a process to add / remove people from the waitlist

Settings page (cog on profile):

1. This needs to be implemented
   a. Implement logout / deactivate account
