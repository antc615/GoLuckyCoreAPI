Difference between user interaction model and analytics models:
User Interaction Model
Focus: Direct interactions between users (e.g., viewing profiles, sending winks).
Purpose: Enhances user experience by tracking and potentially responding to specific actions (like showing mutual interests or notifying a user when their profile is viewed).
Data Utilization: Primarily used for improving user matching, notifying users of interest, and potentially for recommendations.
Analytics App Models
UserEngagementMetric: Tracks broader engagement metrics, like session duration, frequency of app usage, or activity levels.
FeatureUsageStat: Focuses on how different features of the app are used, which can guide product development and feature enhancements.
BehavioralPattern: Analyzes patterns in user behavior, potentially for personalizing user experience or for business insights.
While there is overlap in the sense that both approaches aim to understand and enhance user experience through data, the "User Interaction" model is more about capturing specific actions between users, and the Analytics app models provide aggregated insights about user behavior and app usage trends. Both are valuable and can synergistically contribute to a comprehensive understanding of user behavior in your dating app.

CELERY RABBIT DJANOG:
Django Application → RabbitMQ (Broker):

When an asynchronous task needs to be performed, your Django application sends a message (representing this task) to RabbitMQ. This message includes all the information necessary to execute the task.
In your case, the CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost//' setting in Django tells Celery to use RabbitMQ running on localhost with the default guest username and password.
RabbitMQ (Broker) Queue:

RabbitMQ holds this task in a queue. It’s responsible for managing these task queues, ensuring that they are delivered to an available Celery worker.
RabbitMQ → Celery Worker:

A Celery worker continuously listens for new tasks from RabbitMQ. When a task is available in the queue, the worker picks it up and starts executing it.
The worker is a separate process, possibly running on a different machine, that is dedicated to processing these tasks.
Task Execution:

The Celery worker executes the task independently of your Django application. This means your Django server can continue handling web requests and other operations while the task is processed in the background.
Feedback Loop:

Once the task is completed, the result can be stored in a backend (like a database or cache), or simply acknowledged if no result needs to be kept.
RabbitMQ itself doesn’t send any message back to Django. However, if the task's result needs to be known by the Django application, Celery can store this result in a place where Django can later retrieve it (like a database, cache, or even a file), but this is generally managed within the Celery task's logic.
Why This Process?:

This setup allows Django to offload heavy or time-consuming tasks, ensuring that the web server remains responsive to user requests.
Scalability and reliability: You can have multiple Celery workers and RabbitMQ can efficiently manage tasks among them.
In summary, RabbitMQ as a broker only manages the message queue between Django and Celery. It doesn’t send messages back to Django. The Celery workers are responsible for executing the tasks and handling any results.
