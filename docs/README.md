Difference between user interaction model and analytics models:
User Interaction Model
Focus: Direct interactions between users (e.g., viewing profiles, sending winks).
Purpose: Enhances user experience by tracking and potentially responding to specific actions (like showing mutual interests or notifying a user when their profile is viewed).
Data Utilization: Primarily used for improving user matching, notifying users of interest, and potentially for recommendations.
Analytics App Models
UserEngagementMetric: Tracks broader engagement metrics, like session duration, frequency of app usage, or activity levels.
FeatureUsageStat: Focuses on how different features of the app are used, which can guide product development and feature enhancements.
BehavioralPattern: Analyzes patterns in user behavior, potentially for personalizing user experience or for business insights.
While there is overlap in the sense that both approaches aim to understand and enhance user experience through data, the "User Interaction" model is more about capturing specific actions between users, and the Analytics app models provide aggregated insights about user behavior and app usage trends. Both are valuable and can synergistically contribute to a comprehensive understanding of user behavior in your dating app.
